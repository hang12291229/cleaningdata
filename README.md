# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. You will be graded by your peers on a series of yes/no questions related to the project. You will be required to submit: 1) a tidy data set as described below, 2) a link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis, and 3) a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. You should also include a README.md in the repo with your scripts. This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.

## Steps to get the result 
- Download and unzip the data 
- Read the files and inout the data sets into R , and look over the datasets by str command
- Merge the test and training datasets
- Merge all elements into one data datasets
- Extract the measurement of means and std, and subset the data based on it
- Change labels to descriptive names 
- Replace the labels
- Generate the new output
